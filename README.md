# Into The Failureverse
school project

Into The Failureverse is an prop hunt game made in Unreal Engine 5, but my friend is obsessed with Steven He (hence the name).

If you wanna have a look at the source code or run the game you might have to rename the folder to MyFirstProject - there haven't been any problems for me but who knows?
